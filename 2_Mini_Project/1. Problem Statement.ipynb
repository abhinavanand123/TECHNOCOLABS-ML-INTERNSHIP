    "- An Internet bot is an automated software application. It can run any range of tasks and does so repetitively. The implementation of bots on the Internet is so widespread that bots made up 50% of all online traffic in 2016 [14]. Some of the tasks that bots perform are feed fetchers, commercial crawlers, monitoring, and search engine bots. For example, feed fetchers change the display of websites when they are accessed for mobile users and search engine bots collect metadata that allows the search engine to perform. These tasks shape the Internet as we see it daily.\n",
